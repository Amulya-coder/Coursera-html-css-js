                <h2>Mobile-First Design</h2>
                <p style="color: #fff;">
                  Mobile-first design is more than a buzzword. It’s a reality of our online world today. Websites that are built for mobile are more likely to be indexed first in search engines. According to Google’s 2018 update, mobile-first indexing is already in effect.What does this mean for your website design? It means you’ll need to ensure your design, content, and any social media sharing is done in a mobile-friendly way. Creating a website that works on all screens isn’t particularly challenging today, and most themes and presets are already designed.

                <h2>Stick to Simple</h2>
                <p style="color: #fff;">
                   There’s nothing wrong with interesting, complex web design. In fact, this has its place in the online world. However, there’s also something to be said for the simplicity of a less-is-more theme. Google conducted a study to see how website designs stack up against each other. In this study, they found that visitors aren’t big fans of visual complexity.

Stick to standard layouts that people expect. Even if you use nontraditional elements, keep them within these expected frameworks that make it easier to navigate and find what you’re looking for.

                <h2>Use Visual Cues</h2>
                <p style="color: #fff;">
                   Design today often relies on visual clues. Humans are visual creatures. They sometimes need help knowing where to look. If your design is overwhelming, your users might not know where to look, and this will keep them from converting on your page.

First, decide where you want users to focus on. This might be a block of text, blog post, or even a signup form. From there, you need a plan to draw attention to this feature. Using well-planned images, arrows, or even just bolt text can act as a visual cue to direct user attention.
