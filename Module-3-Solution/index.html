                 Text balance
The fonts you use on your website play a huge part in how it presents. Text sizes, line heights and the number of fonts used on a page all impact presentation.<br>
<b>Size matters.</b>From our experience, 14px to 18px is a good size for standard body text with supporting text such as label and captions often being around 13px to 14px. While it’s difficult to state the optimal sizes for all header tags (main headlines) , H1s are commonly 36px to 50px with H2’s between 36px and 30px and the size decreases as the hierarchy goes down. A good way to determine if your visual hierarchy needs modification is to squint until all the words are a blur. If you’re unable to make any distinctions between the text, you might want to reconsider the sizes being used.<br>
<b>Line height.</b> Depending on the typeface chosen and whether it’s for body text or headline text, optimal line height often falls between 1 and 1.5x the font size. If you’re either side of that range you’re a sinner.<br>
<b>Colours.</b> It sounds so simple but there are many ways this can go wrong. Light text on a white background. Poorly balanced background and text colours. If your site visitor struggles to read the text then it’s more likely they’ll leave.<br>
<b>Number of fonts.</b> With a huge amount of fonts available to us, it’s easy to want to use ALL of them. We’ve been guilty of using a few too many fonts’s on sites in the past but we’ve learned the error of our ways. Keep the number of fonts used down to a maximum of 2. More than that and things can start to look messy.

              <p>
                A website has 7 seconds to grab a visitors attention before they leave. Truth! And once they’re gone there’s no coming back. It’s important to very clearly communicate who you are and what you do quickly and with a minimum of fuss. Less is often more but it’s a delicate balance. Either way, if you try to communicate too much or too little then you risk alienating your audience.
Once you’ve captured your visitors attention it’s incredibly important to ensure they can find the information they’re looking for. A clean, simple menu structure and intuitive navigation helps enhance the user experience, creates further engagement and guides site visitors towards the information they need.<br>
<b>Pop up</b> advertising is still widely used, especially on sites that are marketing products and services. We recognise the temptation for businesses to use pop-ups once a visitor has been on the site for a period of time or is trying to leave the site. Our advice is don’t — unless absolutely necessary. No one likes a pushy sales person and we’ve become increasingly savvy to online marketing tactics.<br>
White space is an integral part of all good design but is one of the most misunderstood parts of a website's presentation. Web designers want to use white space, business owners want to fill it and see it as a waste of space.
Whitespace allows your content room to breathe. The space between content makes text more legible, headlines stand out more and navigation more intuitive.<br>

              <p>
                The right images will capture a visitor’s attention, inform them of a particular message and keep them engaged. In a world of short attention spans the old saying ‘an image speaks a thousand words’ is more relevant today than ever before.
Finding images that align with your brand, convey a message and look authentic is not easy. If you’re ever looking for a time vacuum we recommend spending half an hour on Shutterstock. It can be quite a soul destroying. There are a lot of great free stock sites that are worth exploring and a few great paid stock sites — but they can get expensive.
Alongside unrealistic stock images, uploading a full resolution unoptimised image is arguably one of the most common sins committed. We often see sites with high-resolution images that are better suited to full-size billboards than a handheld device. At Start Digital we resize and compress all our images to ensure the site loads quickly without losing quality. Our full-screen images don’t exceed 2000 pixels wide and, ideally, should be below 250kb. What's more, all images should be tagged so that search engines understand what each photo represents. This is almost a post in itself.
<b>Unnecessary Animation</b> is also abig factor When used in the right way animation can enhance a site design and help engage site visitors. Subtle movements, image hover states, and even video can go a long way towards improving user experience and creating something that is interesting to interact with.<br>
